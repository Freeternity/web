to get couchdb running smoothly, you shall need to set a password and a cookie string as follows:
$ sudo snap set couchdb admin=[your-password-goes-here] setcookie=[your-cookie-goes-here]
$ sudo snap start couchdb 

put couchdb sudo snap start couchdb in crontab -e from root

from the codebase in index.js, couchdb can run as the var nano = require('nano')('http://admin:freeternity45@localhost:5984');
