* get the recreate.js script working to recreate all of the databases.
* [done by alex - the resolution was to use app passwords from bitbucket - check /home/freeternity/web/conf/bitbucket* for the app password use to git push origin master] git push is not working.  Try git remote set-url to change the url from an ssh request to https://
* [done by alex] find out about adding the couchdb username and password admin:password to the index.js settings
* figure out why the styling for freeternity.com is not being loaded up with nginx in /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/freeternity*
* fix the crontab -e functionality so that at @reboot the server node index.js starts up on user freeternity
* figure out why the images are not showing up same with the css on freeternity.com. I would check nginx conf.
* upgrade the packages to the latest versions in package_*.json - there are a lot of deprication warnings:
